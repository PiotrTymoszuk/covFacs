abstract = {Fundamental cellular operations, including DNA synthesis and the generation of ATP, require iron. Viruses hijack cells in order to replicate, and efficient replication needs an iron-replete host. Some viruses selectively infect iron-acquiring cells by binding to transferrin receptor 1 during cell entry. Other viruses alter the expression of proteins involved in iron homeostasis, such as HFE and hepcidin. In HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus infections, iron overload is associated with poor prognosis and could be partly caused by the viruses themselves. Understanding how iron metabolism and viral infection interact might suggest new methods to control disease.},

abstract = {Anemia is very common in patients with inflammatory disorders. Its prevalence is associated with severity of the underlying disease, and it negatively affects quality of life and cardiovascular performance of patients. Anemia of inflammation (AI) is caused by disturbances of iron metabolism resulting in iron retention within macrophages, a reduced erythrocyte half-life, and cytokine mediated inhibition of erythropoietin function and erythroid progenitor cell differentiation. AI is mostly mild to moderate, normochromic and normocytic, and characterized by low circulating iron, but normal and increased levels of the storage protein ferritin and the iron hormone hepcidin. The primary therapeutic approach for AI is treatment of the underlying inflammatory disease which mostly results in normalization of hemoglobin levels over time unless other pathologies such as vitamin deficiencies, true iron deficiency on the basis of bleeding episodes, or renal insufficiency are present. If the underlying disease and/or anemia are not resolved, iron supplementation therapy and/or treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents may be considered whereas blood transfusions are an emergency treatment for life-threatening anemia. New treatments with hepcidin-modifying strategies and stabilizers of hypoxia inducible factors emerge but their therapeutic efficacy for treatment of AI in ill patients needs to be evaluated in clinical trials.},

abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged at the end of 2019 in China and affected the entire world population, either by infection and its health consequences, or by restrictions in daily life as a consequence of hygiene measures and containment strategies. As of September 2021, more than 231,000.000 infections and 4,740.000 deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported. The infections present with varied clinical symptoms and severity, ranging from asymptomatic course to fatal outcome. Several risk factors for a severe course of the disease have been identified, the most important being age, gender, comorbidities, lifestyle, and genetics. While most patients recover within several weeks, some report persistent symptoms restricting their daily lives and activities, termed as post-COVID. Over the past 18months, we have acquired significant knowledge as reflected by an almost uncountable number of publications on the nature of the underlying virus and its evolution, host responses to infection, modes of transmission, and different clinical presentations of the disease. Along this line, new diagnostic tests and algorithms have been developed paralleled by the search for and clinical evaluation of specific treatments for the different stages of the disease. In addition, preventive non-pharmacological measures have been implemented to control the spread of infection in the community. While an effective antiviral therapy is not yet available, numerous vaccines including novel vaccine technologies have been developed, which show high protection from infection and specifically from a severe course or death from COVID-19. In this review, we tried to provide an up-to-date schematic of COVID-19, including aspects of epidemiology, virology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, therapy, and prevention.},

abstract = {Three distinct human monocyte subsets have been identified based on the surface marker expression of CD14 and CD16. We hypothesized that monocytes were likely more heterogeneous in composition. Approach and Results - We used the high dimensionality of mass cytometry together with the FlowSOM clustering algorithm to accurately identify and define monocyte subsets in blood of healthy human subjects and those with coronary artery disease (CAD). To study the behavior and functionality of the newly defined monocyte subsets, we performed RNA sequencing, transwell migration, and efferocytosis assays. Here, we identify 8 human monocyte subsets based on their surface marker phenotype. We found that 3 of these subsets fall within the CD16+ nonclassical monocyte population and 4 subsets belong to the CD14+ classical monocytes, illustrating significant monocyte heterogeneity in humans. As nonclassical monocytes are important in modulating atherosclerosis in mice, we studied the functions of our 3 newly identified nonclassical monocytes in subjects with CAD. We found a marked expansion of a Slan+CXCR6+ nonclassical monocyte subset in CAD subjects, which was positively correlated with CAD severity. This nonclassical subset can migrate towards CXCL16 and shows an increased efferocytosis capacity, indicating it may play an atheroprotective role. Conclusions - Our data demonstrate that human nonclassical monocytes are a heterogeneous population, existing of several subsets with functional differences. These subsets have changed frequencies in the setting of severe CAD. Understanding how these newly identified subsets modulate CAD will be important for CAD-based therapies that target myeloid cells.},

The exaggerated host immune response, incapable of viral clearance, instead aggravates respiratory distress, as well as cardiac, and/or damage to other organs. The mortality pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection, higher in older versus younger adults and almost absent in children, is possibly caused by the effects of age and pre-existing comorbidities on innate and adaptive immunity. Here, we speculate that the abnormal and excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection partly depends on T cell immunological memory, which is more pronounced in adults compared with children, and may significantly contribute to immunopathology and massive collateral damage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.},

abstract = {Iron is a constituent of many metalloproteins involved in vital metabolic functions. While adequate iron supply is critical for health, accumulation of excess iron promotes oxidative stress and causes tissue injury and disease. Therefore, iron homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. Mammals have developed elegant homeostatic mechanisms at the cellular and systemic level, which serve to satisfy metabolic needs for iron and to minimize the risks posed by iron's toxicity. Cellular iron metabolism is post-transcriptionally controlled by iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, while systemic iron balance is regulated by the iron hormone hepcidin. This review summarizes basic principles of mammalian iron homeostasis at the cellular and systemic level. Particular attention is given on pathways for hepcidin regulation and on crosstalk between cellular and systemic homeostatic mechanisms.},

Memory consumption has decreased dramatically, amongst others, by replacing the old interface to the underlying compiled code by a new one relying on Rcpp. The batch SOM algorithm for training has been added in both sequential and parallel forms. A final important extension of the package's repertoire is the possibility to define and use data-dependent distance functions, extremely useful in cases where standard distances like the Euclidean distance are not appropriate.

abstract = {Myelomonocytic cells are critically involved in iron turnover as aged RBC recyclers. Human monocytes are divided in 3 subpopulations of classical, intermediate, and nonclassical cells, differing in inflammatory and migratory phenotype. Their functions in iron homeostasis are, however, unclear. Here, we asked whether the functional diversity of monocyte subsets translates into differences in handling physiological and pathological iron species. By microarray data analysis and flow cytometry we identified a set of iron-related genes and proteins upregulated in classical and, in part, intermediate monocytes. These included the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN1), ferritin, transferrin receptor, putative transporters of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), and receptors for damaged erythrocytes. Consequently, classical monocytes displayed superior scavenging capabilities of potentially toxic NTBI, which were augmented by blocking iron export via hepcidin. The same subset and, to a lesser extent, the intermediate population, efficiently cleared damaged erythrocytes in vitro and mediated erythrophagocytosis in vivo in healthy volunteers and patients having received blood transfusions. To summarize, our data underline the physiologically important function of the classical and intermediate subset in clearing NTBI and damaged RBCs. As such, these cells may play a nonnegligible role in iron homeostasis and limit iron toxicity in iron overload conditions.},

abstract = {Background: Sepsis, a dysregulated host response following infection, is associated with massive immune activation and high mortality rates. There is still a need to define further risk factors and laboratory parameters predicting the clinical course. Iron metabolism is regulated by both, the body's iron status and the immune response. Iron itself is required for erythropoiesis but also for many cellular and metabolic functions. Moreover, iron availability is a critical determinant in infections because it is an essential nutrient for most microbes but also impacts on immune function and intravascular oxidative stress. Herein, we used a prospective study design to investigate the putative impact of serum iron parameters on the outcome of sepsis. Methods: Serum markers of iron metabolism were measured in a prospective cohort of 61 patients (37 males, 24 females) with sepsis defined by Sepsis-3 criteria in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Regulation of iron parameters in patients stratified by focus of infection and co-medication as well as association of the markers with sepsis severity scores and survival were investigated with linear and logistic regression corrected for sex and age effects. Results: Positive correlations of increased serum iron and ferritin concentrations upon ICU admission with the severity of organ failure (SOFA score) and with mortality were observed. Moreover, high TF-Sat, elevated ferritin and serum iron levels and low transferrin concentrations were associated with reduced survival. A logistic regression model consisting of SOFA and transferrin saturation (SOFA-TF-Sat) had the best predictive power for survival in septic ICU patients. Of note, administration of blood transfusions prior to ICU admission resulted in increased TF-Sat and reduced survival of septic patients. Conclusions: Our study could show an important impact of serum iron parameters on the outcome of sepsis. Furthermore, we identified transferrin saturation as a stand-alone predictor of sepsis survival and as a parameter of iron metabolism which may in a combined model improve the prediction power of the SOFA score. Trial registration: The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki on biomedical research. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review board of the Medical University Innsbruck (study AN2013-0006).},

Material/Methods: This was a retrospective study enrolling a total of 50 patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from February 27, 2020 to March 30, 2020, including a severe group (12 patients) and a mild group (38 patients). For the control group, 50 healthy people were examined during the same period. We compared clinical laboratory data and iron homeostasis biomarkers among the 3 groups. ROC curve analysis was used to assess diagnoses. Results: Patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 had higher hepcidin and serum ferritin levels than in other groups (p<0.001). A combination test of hepcidin and serum ferritin provided the best specificity and sensitivity in the prognosis of COVID-19 severity. Logistic regression analysis showed hepcidin and serum ferritin independently contributed to the severity of COVID-19. Hepcidin and serum ferritin tandem testing predicted COVID-19 severity with 94.6% specificity, while hepcidin and serum ferritin parallel testing had a sensitivity of 95.7%. Conclusions: Iron homeostasis had a robust association with the occurrence of severe COVID-19. Iron homeostasis determinations were specific and sensitive for the early prediction of disease severity in COVID-19 patients and thus have clinical utility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is considerable variation in disease behavior among patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Genomewide association analysis may allow for the identification of potential genetic factors involved in the development of Covid-19. METHODS: We conducted a genomewide association study involving 1980 patients with Covid-19 and severe disease (defined as respiratory failure) at seven hospitals in the Italian and Spanish epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. After quality control and the exclusion of population outliers, 835 patients and 1255 control participants from Italy and 775 patients and 950 control participants from Spain were included in the final analysis. In total, we analyzed 8,582,968 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and conducted a meta-analysis of the two case-control panels. RESULTS: We detected cross-replicating associations with rs11385942 at locus 3p21.31 and with rs657152 at locus 9q34.2, which were significant at the genomewide level (P<5×10(-8)) in the meta-analysis of the two case-control panels (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48 to 2.11; P = 1.15×10(-10); and odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47; P = 4.95×10(-8), respectively). At locus 3p21.31, the association signal spanned the genes SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6 and XCR1. The association signal at locus 9q34.2 coincided with the ABO blood group locus; in this cohort, a blood-group-specific analysis showed a higher risk in blood group A than in other blood groups (odds ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.75; P = 1.48×10(-4)) and a protective effect in blood group O as compared with other blood groups (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.79; P = 1.06×10(-5)).

abstract = {<p>After more than one year since the COVID-19 outbreak, patients with severe disease still constitute the bottleneck of the pandemic management. Aberrant inflammatory responses, ranging from cytokine storm to immune-suppression, were described in COVID-19 and no treatment was demonstrated to change the prognosis significantly. Therefore, there is an urgent need for understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanisms to guide therapeutic interventions. This study was designed to assess myeloid cell activation and phenotype leading to recovery in patients surviving severe COVID-19. We evaluated longitudinally patients with COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency, stratified according to the need of intensive care unit admission (ICU, n = 11, and No-ICU, n = 9), and age and sex matched healthy controls (HCs, n = 11), by flow cytometry and a wide array of serum inflammatory/immune-regulatory mediators. All patients featured systemic immune-regulatory myeloid cell phenotype as assessed by both unsupervised and supervised analysis of circulating monocyte and dendritic cell subsets. Specifically, we observed a reduction of CD14lowCD16+ monocytes, and reduced expression of CD80, CD86, and Slan. Moreover, mDCs, pDCs, and basophils were significantly reduced, in comparison to healthy subjects. Contemporaneously, both monocytes and DCs showed increased expression of CD163, CD204, CD206, and PD-L1 immune-regulatory markers. The expansion of M2-like monocytes was significantly higher at admission in patients featuring detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load and it was positively correlated with the levels of specific antibodies. In No-ICU patients, we observed a peak of the alterations at admission and a progressive regression to a phenotype similar to HCs at discharge. Interestingly, in ICU patients, the expression of immuno-suppressive markers progressively increased until discharge. Notably, an increase of M2-like HLA-DRhighPD-L1+ cells in CD14++CD16− monocytes and in dendritic cell subsets was observed at ICU discharge. Furthermore, IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-12p40 showed a decline over time in ICU patients, while high values of IL1RA and IL-10 were maintained. In conclusion, these results support that timely acquisition of a myeloid cell immune-regulatory phenotype might contribute to recovery in severe systemic SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that therapeutic agents favoring an innate immune system regulatory shift may represent the best strategy to be implemented at this stage.</p>},

abstract = {Hepcidin is a peptide hormone secreted by the liver in response to iron loading and inflammation. Decreased hepcidin leads to tissue iron overload, whereas hepcidin overproduction leads to hypoferremia and the anemia of inflammation. Ferroportin is an iron exporter present on the surface of absorptive enterocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and placental cells. Here we report that hepcidin bound to ferroportin in tissue culture cells. After binding, ferroportin was internalized and degraded, leading to decreased export of cellular iron. The posttranslational regulation of ferroportin by hepcidin may thus complete a homeostatic loop: Iron regulates the secretion of hepcidin, which in turn controls the concentration of ferroportin on the cell surface.},

@misc{Haschka2021,
abstract = {The control over iron availability is crucial under homeostatic conditions and even more in the case of an infection. This results from diverse properties of iron: first, iron is an important trace element for the host as well as for the pathogen for various cellular and metabolic processes, second, free iron catalyzes Fenton reaction and is therefore producing reactive oxygen species as a part of the host defense machinery, third, iron exhibits important effects on immune cell function and differentiation and fourth almost every immune activation in turn impacts on iron metabolism and spatio-temporal iron distribution. The central importance of iron in the host and microbe interplay and thus for the course of infections led to diverse strategies to restrict iron for invading pathogens. In this review we focus on how iron restriction to the pathogen is a powerful innate immune defense mechanism of the host called “nutritional immunity”. Important proteins in the iron-host-pathogen interplay will be discussed as well as the influence of iron on the efficacy of innate and adaptive immunity. Recently described processes like ferritinophagy and ferroptosis are further covered in respect to their impact on inflammation and infection control and how they impact on our understanding of the interaction of host and pathogen.},

abstract = {Background: Prognostic markers for disease severity and identification of therapeutic targets in COVID-19 are urgently needed. We have studied innate and adaptive immunity on protein and transcriptomic level in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity at admission and longitudinally during hospitalization. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at three time points from 31 patients included in the Norwegian SARS-CoV-2 cohort study and analysed by flow cytometry and RNA sequencing. Patients were grouped as either mild/moderate (n = 14), severe (n = 11) or critical (n = 6) disease in accordance with WHO guidelines and compared with patients with SARS-CoV-2-negative bacterial sepsis (n = 5) and healthy controls (n = 10). Results: COVID-19 severity was characterized by decreased interleukin 7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) expression in na{\"{i}}ve CD4 and CD8 T cells. Activation (CD25 and HLA-DR) and exhaustion (PD-1) markers on T cells were increased compared with controls, but comparable between COVID-19 severity groups. Non-classical monocytes and monocytic HLA-DR expression decreased whereas monocytic PD-L1 and CD142 expression increased with COVID-19 severity. RNA sequencing exhibited increased plasma B-cell activity in critical COVID-19 and yet predominantly reduced transcripts related to immune response pathways compared with milder disease. Conclusion: Critical COVID-19 seems to be characterized by an immune profile of activated and exhausted T cells and monocytes. This immune phenotype may influence the capacity to mount an efficient T-cell immune response. Plasma B-cell activity and calprotectin were higher in critical COVID-19 while most transcripts related to immune functions were reduced, in particular affecting B cells. The potential of these cells as therapeutic targets in COVID-19 should be further explored.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Recently, the official nomenclature subdivides monocytes into three subsets, the additional subset arising from the segregation of the CD16+ monocytes into two based on relative expression of CD14.

In this review, we discuss these recent results, and also the description and utility of this new segregation in several disease conditions. We also discuss alternative markers for segregating the monocyte subsets, for example using Tie-2 and slan, which do not necessarily follow the official method of segregating monocyte subsets based on relative CD14 and CD16 expressions.},

abstract = {Introduction: Studies have shown that iron metabolism is affected by coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which has spread worldwide and has become a global health problem. Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 and serum erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin, and haptoglobin (Hpt) levels with disease severity, and other biochemical values. Methods: Fifty nine COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and wards in our hospital between March and June 2020 and 19 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Participants were divided into mild, severe, and critical disease severity groups. Group mean values were analyzed with SPSS according to disease severity, mortality, and intubation status. Results: Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly lower in the critical patient group (P <.0001) and deceased group (P <.0001). The red blood cell distribution width-coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and ferritin values were significantly higher in the intubated (P =.001, P =.005) and deceased (P =.014, P =.003) groups. Ferritin values were positively correlated with disease severity (P <.0001). Serum iron levels were lower in the patient group compared with the reference range. (P <.0001). It was found that the transferrin saturation (TfSat) was lower in the patient group compared with the control group (P <.0001). It was found that the mean EPO of the deceased was lower than the control group and the survived patient group (P =.035). Hepcidin levels were found to be significantly lower in the patient group (P <.0001). Hpt values were found to be significantly lower in the intubated group (P =.004) and the deceased group (P =.042). Conclusion: In our study, while serum iron and hepcidin levels decreased in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, we found that EPO and Hpt levels were significantly lower in critical and deceased patient groups. Our study is the first study examining EPO and Hpt levels in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.},

Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of 5 healthy donors and 13 patients with COVID-19, including moderate, severe and convalescent cases. Through determining the transcriptional profiles of immune cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor and B cell receptor sequences, we analyzed the functional properties of immune cells. Most cell types in patients with COVID-19 showed a strong interferon-$\alpha$ response and an overall acute inflammatory response. Moreover, intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+ effector-GNLY (granulysin), CD8+ effector-GNLY and NKT CD160, was associated with convalescence in moderate patients. In severe patients, the immune landscape featured a deranged interferon response, profound immune exhaustion with skewed T cell receptor repertoire and broad T cell expansion. These findings illustrate the dynamic nature of immune responses during disease progression.},

However, whether immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) differ between sexes, and whether such differences correlate with the sex difference in the disease course of COVID-19, is currently unknown. Here we examined sex differences in viral loads, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titres, plasma cytokines and blood-cell phenotyping in patients with moderate COVID-19 who had not received immunomodulatory medications. Male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. By contrast, female patients had more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients' age and was associated with worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. By contrast, higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worse disease progression in female patients, but not in male patients.

abstract = {In humans, the monocyte pool comprises three subsets (classical, intermediate, and nonclassical) that circulate in dynamic equilibrium. The kinetics underlying their generation, differentiation, and disappearance are critical to understanding both steady-state homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Here, using human in vivo deuterium labeling, we demonstrate that classical monocytes emerge first from marrow, after a postmitotic interval of 1.6 d, and circulate for a day. Subsequent labeling of intermediate and nonclassical monocytes is consistent with a model of sequential transition. Intermediate and nonclassical monocytes have longer circulating lifespans (∼4 and ∼7 d, respectively). In a human experimental endotoxemia model, a transient but profound monocytopenia was observed; restoration of circulating monocytes was achieved by the early release of classical monocytes from bone marrow. The sequence of repopulation recapitulated the order of maturation in healthy homeostasis. This developmental relationship between monocyte subsets was verified by fate mapping grafted human classical monocytes into humanized mice, which were able to differentiate sequentially into intermediate and nonclassical cells.},

The study aimed to investigate the role of soluble (s)CD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels in predicting disease severity and characterize peripheral blood monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID-19 subjects). Methods: On admission, in COVID-19 subjects sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, and peripheral blood monocyte and DC subsets were compared to healthy donors (HDs). According to clinical outcome, COVID-19 subjects were divided into ARDS and non-ARDS groups. Results: Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed higher sCD163 (p<0.0001) and sCD14 (p<0.0001) plasmatic levels. We observed higher sCD163 plasmatic levels in the ARDS group compared to the non-ARDS one (p=0.002). The cut-off for sCD163 plasmatic level greater than 2032 ng/ml was predictive of disease severity (AUC: 0.6786, p=0.0022; sensitivity 56.7% [CI: 44.1–68.4] specificity 73.8% [CI: 58.9–84.7]). Positive correlation between plasmatic levels of sCD163, LDH and IL-6 and between plasmatic levels of sCD14, D-dimer and ferritin were found. Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed lower percentages of non-classical (p=0.0012) and intermediate monocytes (p=0.0447), slanDCs (p<0.0001), myeloid DCs (mDCs, p<0.0001), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, p=0.0014). Compared to the non-ARDS group, the ARDS group showed lower percentages of non-classical monocytes (p=0.0006), mDCs (p=0.0346), and pDCs (p=0.0492). Conclusions: The increase in sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, observed on hospital admission in COVID-19 subjects, especially in those who developed ARDS, and the correlations of these monocyte/macrophage activation markers with typical inflammatory markers of COVID-19 pneumonia, underline their potential use to assess the risk of progression of the disease. In an early stage of the disease, the assessment of sCD163 plasmatic levels could have clinical utility in predicting the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.},

abstract = {Under chronic inflammatory conditions cytokines induce a diversion of iron traffic, leading to hypoferremia and retention of the metal within the reticuloendothelial system. However, the regulatory pathways underlying these disturbances of iron homeostasis are poorly understood. We investigated transferrin receptor (TfR)-dependent and -independent iron transport mechanisms in cytokine-stimulated human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and U937. Combined treatment of cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduced TfR mRNA levels, surface expression, and iron uptake, and these effects were reversed by interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus stimulating TfR-mediated iron acquisition. IFN-gamma and LPS dose-dependently increased the cellular expression of divalent metal transporter-1, a transmembrane transporter of ferrous iron, and stimulated the uptake of nontransferrin bound iron (NTBI) into cells. At the same time, IFN-gamma and LPS down-regulated the expression of ferroportin mRNA, a putative iron exporter, and decreased iron release from monocytes. Preincubation with IL-10 partly counteracted these effects. Our results demonstrate that the proinflammatory stimuli IFN-gamma and LPS increase the uptake of NTBI via stimulation of divalent metal transporter-1 expression and cause retention of the metal within monocytes by down-regulating ferroportin synthesis. Opposite, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 stimulates TfR-mediated iron uptake into activated monocytes. The regulation of iron transport by cytokines is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease and a promising target for therapeutic intervention.},

Pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes are regarded as the central drivers of the cytokine storm associated with the severity of COVID-19. In this study, we explored the characteristic peripheral cellular profiles of patients with COVID-19 in both acute and convalescent phases by single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a combination of algorithm-guided data analyses, we identified peripheral immune cell subsets in COVID-19 and revealed CD4+ T-cell depletion, T-cell differentiation, plasma cell expansion, and the reduced antigen presentation capacity of innate immunity. Notably, COVID-19 induces a dysregulation in the balance of monocyte populations by the expansion of the monocyte subsets. Collectively, our results represent a high-dimensional, single-cell profile of the peripheral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

abstract = {Mass cytometry (CyTOF) represents one of the most powerful tools in immune phenotyping, allowing high throughput quantification of over 40 parameters at single-cell resolution. However, wide deployment of CyTOF-based immune phenotyping studies are limited by complex experimental workflows and the need for specialized CyTOF equipment and technical expertise. Furthermore, differences in cell isolation and enrichment protocols, antibody reagent preparation, sample staining, and data acquisition protocols can all introduce technical variation that can confound integrative analyses of large data-sets of samples processed across multiple labs. Here, we present a streamlined whole blood CyTOF workflow which addresses many of these sources of experimental variation and facilitates wider adoption of CyTOF immune monitoring across sites with limited technical expertise or sample-processing resources or equipment. Our workflow utilizes commercially available reagents including the Fluidigm MaxPar Direct Immune Profiling Assay (MDIPA), a dry tube 30-marker immunophenotyping panel, and SmartTube Proteomic Stabilizer, which allows for simple and reliable fixation and cryopreservation of whole blood samples. We validate a workflow that allows for streamlined staining of whole blood samples with minimal processing requirements or expertise at the site of sample collection, followed by shipment to a central CyTOF core facility for batched downstream processing and data acquisition. We apply this workflow to characterize 184 whole blood samples collected longitudinally from a cohort of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, highlighting dynamic disease-associated changes in circulating immune cell frequency and phenotype.},

abstract = {Aims: To elucidate the prognostic role of monocytes in the immune response of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at risk for life-threatening heart and lung injury as major complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods and results: From February to April 2020, we prospectively studied a cohort of 96 participants comprising 47 consecutive patients with CAD and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (CAD + SARS-CoV-2), 19 CAD patients without infections, and 30 healthy controls. Clinical assessment included blood sampling, echocardiography, and electrocardiography within 12 h of admission. Respiratory failure was stratified by the Horovitz Index (HI) as moderately/severely impaired when HI ≤200 mmHg. The clinical endpoint (EP) was defined as HI ≤200 mmHg with subsequent mechanical ventilation within a follow-up of 30 days. The numbers of CD14dimCD16+ non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were remarkably low in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 compared with CAD patients without infection and healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Moreover, these CD14dimCD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T-cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, and HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, P = 0.025). Conclusion: Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients. Intensified risk assessments comprising monocyte sub-and phenotypes may help to identify patients at risk for respiratory failure.},

abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is rapidly spreading worldwide. There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results: We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (> 9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in the clinic.},

abstract = {Background Divalent metals play important roles in maintaining metabolism and cellular growth of both eukaryotic hosts and invading microbes. Both metal deficiency and overload can result in abnormal cellular function or damage. Given its central role in host–pathogen interactions, subtle alterations of divalent metal homeostasis can occur in the course of infectious diseases which aim, from the host perspective, either to reduce the availability of respective metals to microbes or to use toxic metal accumulation to eliminate pathogens. Aims To provide the reader with background information and clinical data on divalent metal homeostasis in host–pathogen interactions, how this affects the course of infectious disease and whether correction of metal disturbances has shown benefit in infections. Sources An in-depth analysis of PubMed articles related to the topic of this review published in English between 1970 and 2016 was performed. Content From the microbial perspective, divalent metals are essential for growth and pathogenicity and to mount effective protection against antimicrobial host responses, including toxic radical formation. Microbes have evolved multiple strategies to control their access to divalent metals. From the clinical perspective, alterations of divalent metal levels may result in increased or decreased susceptibility to infection and often occur in response to infections. However, keeping in mind the strategies underlying such alterations, for which the term ‘nutritional immunity' was coined, the uncritical correction of such divalent metal imbalances may cause harm to patients. This review addresses the role of the divalent metals iron, selenium, zinc, manganese and copper in infectious diseases from a mechanistic and clinical perspective. Implications We point out areas of research needed to expand our limited knowledge, hoping to improve the clinical management of patients with infections and to identify promising new targets for treatment by modulation of host or microbe divalent metal metabolism.},

abstract = {Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) is an innate immune peptide with pleiotropic effects. Lcn2 binds iron-laden bacterial siderophores, chemo-attracts neutrophils and has immunomodulatory and apoptosis-regulating effects. In this study we show that upon infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Lcn2 promotes iron export from Salmonella-infected macrophages, which reduces cellular iron content and enhances the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lcn2 represses IL-10 production while augmenting Nos2, TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 expression. Lcn2(-/-) macrophages have elevated IL-10 levels as a consequence of increased iron content. The crucial role of Lcn-2/IL-10 interactions was further demonstrated by the greater ability of Lcn2(-/-) IL-10(-/-) macrophages and mice to control intracellular Salmonella proliferation in comparison to Lcn2(-/-) counterparts. Over-expression of the iron exporter ferroportin-1 in Lcn2(-/-) macrophages represses IL-10 and restores TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 production to the levels found in wild-type macrophages, so that killing and clearance of intracellular Salmonella is promoted. Our observations suggest that Lcn2 promotes host resistance to Salmonella Typhimurium infection by binding bacterial siderophores and suppressing IL-10 production, and that both functions are linked to its ability to shuttle iron from macrophages.

abstract = {Background: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently associated with hyperinflammation and hyperferritinemia. The latter is related to increased mortality in COVID-19. Still, it is not clear if iron dysmetabolism is mechanistically linked to COVID-19 pathobiology. Methods: We herein present data from the ongoing prospective, multicentre, observational CovILD cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04416100), which systematically follows up patients after COVID-19. 109 participants were evaluated 60 days after onset of first COVID-19 symptoms including clinical examination, chest computed tomography and laboratory testing. Results: We investigated subjects with mild to critical COVID-19, of which the majority received hospital treatment. 60 days after disease onset, 30% of subjects still presented with iron deficiency and 9% had anemia, mostly categorized as anemia of inflammation. Anemic patients had increased levels of inflammation markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein and survived a more severe course of COVID-19. Hyperferritinemia was still present in 38% of all individuals and was more frequent in subjects with preceding severe or critical COVID-19. Analysis of the mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated a correlation of increased ferritin and cytokine mRNA expression in these patients. Finally, persisting hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with severe lung pathologies in computed tomography scans and a decreased performance status as compared to patients without hyperferritinemia. Discussion: Alterations of iron homeostasis can persist for at least two months after the onset of COVID-19 and are closely associated with non-resolving lung pathologies and impaired physical performance. Determination of serum iron parameters may thus be a easy to access measure to monitor the resolution of COVID-19. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04416100.},

All healthcare facilities in Bangkok and 12 Regional Health Offices across the country will participate in the project over the next 10 months. The Ministry of Public Health, with support from WHO and the Government of Japan has developed a 'new normal' model for health service delivery to strengthen the healthcare system and support health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The system is being piloted in Pattani province which is located on the border with Malaysia. The "new normal" medical services model also called the "Pattani model" is an innovation in which patients with different diseases are classified into three 'traffic light' groups-green, red and yellow-based on the need for direct medical care and risk of COVID-19 infection. Patients that do not need to visit the healthcare facility are supported by remote consultation (telemedicine) and drugs are delivered to them, often by village volunteers. Arrangements for patients that need to visit healthcare facilities are modified, taking into account the patient pathway and the need to maintain physical distancing. When more intensive care is required, services have been made safer for patients and health care providers-such as upgraded ventilation within facilities. Read the full story here},

It could transform clinical care to have objective immune cell biomarkers that could predict sepsis diagnosis and guide treatment. For decades, neutrophil phenotypes have been studied in sepsis, but a diagnostic cell subset has yet to be identified. Here, high dimensional mass cytometry was used to reveal for the first time a specific neutrophil signature of sepsis severity that does not overlap with other inflammatory biomarkers, and that distinguishes patients with sepsis from those with non-infectious inflammatory syndrome. Unsupervised analysis of 42-dimesional mass cytometry data characterized previously unappreciated heterogeneity within the CD64+ immature neutrophils and revealed two new subsets distinguished by CD123 and PD-L1 expression. These immature neutrophils exhibited diminished activation and phagocytosis functions. The proportion of CD123-expressing neutrophils also correlated with clinical severity. Critically, this study showed that these two new neutrophil subsets were specific to sepsis and detectable by routine flow cytometry using seven markers. The demonstration here that a simple blood test distinguishes sepsis from other inflammatory conditions represents a key biological milestone that can be immediately translated into improvements in patient care.

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than three million deaths globally. The severity of the disease is characterized, in part, by a dysregulated immune response. CD16+ monocytes are innate immune cells involved in inflammatory responses to viral infections, and tissue repair, among other functions. We characterized the transcriptional changes in CD16+ monocytes from PBMC of people with COVID-19, and from healthy individuals using publicly available single cell RNA sequencing data. CD16+ monocytes from people with COVID-19 compared to those from healthy individuals expressed transcriptional changes indicative of increased cell activation, and induction of a migratory phenotype. We also analyzed COVID-19 cases based on severity of the disease and found that mild cases were characterized by upregulation of interferon response and MHC class II related genes, whereas the severe cases had dysregulated expression of mitochondrial and antigen presentation genes, and upregulated inflammatory, cell movement, and apoptotic gene signatures. These results suggest that CD16+ monocytes in people with COVID-19 contribute to a dysregulated host response characterized by decreased antigen presentation, and an elevated inflammatory response with increased monocytic infiltration into tissues. Our results show that there are transcriptomic changes in CD16+ monocytes that may impact the functions of these cells, contributing to the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19.},

In patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with suspected acute infection, we aimed to evaluate the reliability and discriminant ability of 47 leukocyte biomarkers as predictors of sepsis (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ≥ 2 at 24 h and/or 72 h following ED presentation). Methods: In a multi-centre cohort study in four EDs and intensive care units (ICUs), we standardised flow-cytometric leukocyte biomarker measurement and compared patients with suspected acute infection (cohort-1) with two comparator cohorts: ICU patients with established sepsis (cohort-2), and ED patients without infection or systemic inflammation but requiring hospitalization (cohort-3). Results: Between January 2014 and February 2016, we recruited 272, 59 and 75 patients to cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Of 47 leukocyte biomarkers, 14 were non-reliable, and 17 did not discriminate between the three cohorts. Discriminant analyses for predicting sepsis within cohort-1 were undertaken for eight neutrophil (cluster of differentiation antigens (CD) CD15; CD24; CD35; CD64; CD312; CD11b; CD274; CD279), seven monocyte (CD35; CD64; CD312; CD11b; HLA-DR; CD274; CD279) and a CD8 T-lymphocyte biomarker (CD279). Individually, only higher neutrophil CD279 [OR 1.78 (95% CI 1.23–2.57); P = 0.002], higher monocyte CD279 [1.32 (1.03–1.70); P = 0.03], and lower monocyte HLA-DR [0.73 (0.55–0.97); P = 0.03] expression were associated with subsequent sepsis. With logistic regression the optimum biomarker combination was increased neutrophil CD24 and neutrophil CD279, and reduced monocyte HLA-DR expression, but no combination had clinically relevant predictive validity. Conclusions: From a large panel of leukocyte biomarkers, immunosuppression biomarkers were associated with subsequent sepsis in ED patients with suspected acute infection.

abstract = {Programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor system represents a part of recently reported immu-noregulatory pathway. PD-1 is an immune checkpoint molecule, which plays an important role in downregulating the immune system proinflammatory activity. Until recently, PD-1 expression was not established on immune cells of the preterm infants. The study objectives were to confirm expression of the PD-1 receptors on the monocytes isolated from very low birth weight newborns (VLBW), and to analyze their expression during the first week of life and late-onset sepsis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 76 VLBW patients without early-onset sepsis on their 5th day of life (DOL). PD-1 expression was determined on the monocyte subsets (classical, intermediate, non-classical) by flow cytometry. In case of late-onset sepsis (LOS), the same analysis was performed. Our results demonstrated that on the 5th DOL, PD-1 receptors were present in all the monocyte subsets. Children, whose mothers had received antenatal steroids, presented higher absolute numbers of non-classical monocytes with PD-1 expression. Infants born extremely preterm who later developed LOS, initially showed a lower percentage of PD-1 receptor-positive intermediate monocytes in comparison to neonates born very preterm. During LOS, we observed a rise in the percentage of classical monocytes with PD-1 expression. In case of septic shock or fatal outcome, there was a higher percentage and absolute count of intermediate monocytes with PD-1 expression in comparison to children without these complications. In conclusion, monocytes from VLBW children express PD-1 receptors. Antenatal steroid administration seems to induce PD-1 receptor expression in the non-classical monocytes. PD-1 might play a role in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis in the prematurely born children with septic shock and fatal outcome.},

abstract = {Hepcidin, a master regulator of iron homeostasis, is produced in small amounts by inflammatory monocytes/macrophages. Chronic immune activation leads to iron retention within monocytes/macrophages and the development of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). We questioned whether monocyte-derived hepcidin exerts autocrine regulation toward cellular iron metabolism. Monocyte hepcidin mRNA expression was significantly induced within 3 hours after stimulation with LPS or IL-6, and hepcidin mRNA expression was significantly higher in monocytes of ACD patients than in controls. In ACD patients, monocyte hepcidin mRNA levels were significantly correlated to serum IL-6 concentrations, and increased monocyte hepcidin mRNA levels were associated with decreased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin and iron retention in these cells. Transient transfection experiments using a ferroportin/EmGFP fusion protein construct demonstrated that LPS inducible hepcidin expression in THP-1 monocytes resulted in internalization and degradation of ferroportin. Transfection of monocytes with siRNA directed against hepcidin almost fully reversed this lipopolysaccharide-mediated effect. Using ferroportin mutation constructs, we found that ferroportin is mainly targeted by hepcidin when expressed on the cell surface. Our results suggest that ferroportin expression in inflammatory monocytes is negatively affected by autocrine formation of hepcidin, thus contributing to iron sequestration within monocytes as found in ACD.},

In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of the epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we analysed clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shanghai. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, assembled from 112 high-quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) dataset, showed a stable evolution and suggested that there were two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan. Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes. Lymphocytopenia, especially reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts upon hospital admission, was predictive of disease progression. High levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count. The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age and lymphocytopenia (and its associated cytokine storm), whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect outcomes.},

@article{Tibshirani1996,
abstract = {[We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.]},

abstract = {Objectives: Severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are characterized by an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Activated monocytes secrete high levels of cytokines. Human monocytes are divided into three major populations: conventional (CD14posCD16neg), nonclassical (CD14dimCD16pos), and intermediate (CD14posCD16pos) monocytes. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the distribution of conventional (CD16neg) and CD16pos monocytes is different in patients with COVID-19 and whether the variations could be predictive of the outcome of the disease. Methods: We performed a prospective study on 390 consecutive patients referred to the Emergency Unit, with a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2 infection by RT-PCR. Using the CytoDiff™ reagent, an automated routine leukocyte differential, we quantified CD16neg and CD16pos monocytes. Results: In the entire population, median CD16neg and CD16pos monocyte levels (0.398 and 0.054×109/L, respectively) were in the normal range [(0.3–0.7×109/L) and (0.015–0.065×109/L), respectively], but the 35 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a significantly (p<0.001) lower CD16pos monocyte count (0.018 × 109/L) in comparison to the 70 patients who were discharged (0.064 × 109/L) or were hospitalized in conventional units (0.058 × 109/L). By ROC curve analysis, the ratio [absolute neutrophil count/CD16pos monocyte count] was highly discriminant to identify patients requiring ICU hospitalization: with a cut-off 193.1, the sensitivity and the specificity were 74.3 and 81.8%, respectively (area under the curve=0.817). Conclusions: Quantification of CD16pos monocytes and the ratio [absolute neutrophil count/CD16pos monocyte count] could constitute a marker of the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients.},

When the number of SOM units is large, to facilitate quantitative analysis of the map and the data, similar units need to be grouped, i.e., clustered. In this paper, different approaches to clustering of the SOM are considered. In particular, the use of hierarchical agglomerative clustering and partitive clustering using k-means are investigated. The two-stage procedure-first using SOM to produce the prototypes that are then clustered in the second stage-is found to perform well when compared with direct clustering of the data and to reduce the computation time.},

Some individuals may have primary immunodeficiencies that predispose to severe infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To explore the presence of genetic variants associated with primary immunodeficiencies among young patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case series of pairs of brothers without medical history meeting the selection criteria of young (age <35 years) brother pairs admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe COVID-19. Four men from 2 unrelated families were admitted to the ICUs of 4 hospitals in the Netherlands between March 23 and April 12, 2020. The final date of follow-up was May 16, 2020. Available family members were included for genetic variant segregation analysis and as controls for functional experiments. Exposure: Severe COVID-19. Main Outcome and Measures: Results of rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing, performed to identify a potential monogenic cause. Subsequently, basic genetic and immunological tests were performed in primary immune cells isolated from the patients and family members to characterize any immune defects. Results: The 4 male patients had a mean age of 26 years (range, 21-32), with no history of major chronic disease. They were previously well before developing respiratory insufficiency due to severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The mean duration of ventilatory support was 10 days (range, 9-11); the mean duration of ICU stay was 13 days (range, 10-16). One patient died. Rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing of the patients and segregation in available family members identified loss-of-function variants of the X-chromosomal TLR7. In members of family 1, a maternally inherited 4-nucleotide deletion was identified (c.2129_2132del; p.[Gln710Argfs*18]); the affected members of family 2 carried a missense variant (c.2383G>T; p.[Val795Phe]). In primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients, downstream type I interferon (IFN) signaling was transcriptionally downregulated, as measured by significantly decreased mRNA expression of IRF7, IFNB1, and ISG15 on stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as compared with family members and controls. The production of IFN-$\gamma$, a type II IFN, was decreased in patients in response to stimulation with imiquimod. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series of 4 young male patients with severe COVID-19, rare putative loss-of-function variants of X-chromosomal TLR7 were identified that were associated with impaired type I and II IFN responses. These preliminary findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19..},

abstract = {Introduction: Congenital heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) initiates an immune response which frequently leads to organ dysfunction and a systemic inflammatory response. Complications associated with exacerbated immune responses may severely impact the postoperative recovery. The objective was to describe the characteristics of monocyte subpopulations and neutrophils at the level of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and the cytokine response after CPB in infants. Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted between June 2016 and June 2017 of infants < 2 years of age, electively admitted for surgical correction of acyanotic congenital heart defects using CPB. Fourteen blood samples were collected sequentially and processed immediately during and up to 48 h following cardiac surgery for each patient. Flow cytometry analysis comprised monocytic and granulocytic surface expression of CD14, CD16, CD64, TLR2, TLR4 and Dectin-1 (CLEC7A). Monocyte subpopulations were further defined as classical (CD14++/CD16−), intermediate (CD14++/CD16+) and nonclassical (CD14+/CD16++) monocytes. Plasma concentrations of 14 cytokines, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1$\beta$, IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, MIP-1$\beta$ (CCL4) and TGF-$\beta$1, were measured using multiplex immunoassay for seven points in time. Results: Samples from 21 infants (median age 7.4 months) were analyzed by flow cytometry and from 11 infants, cytokine concentrations were measured. Classical and intermediate monocytes showed first receptor upregulation with an increase in CD64 expression four hours post CPB. CD64–expression on intermediate monocytes almost tripled 48 h post CPB (p < 0.0001). TLR4 was only increased on intermediate monocytes, occurring 12 h post CPB (p = 0.0406) along with elevated TLR2 levels (p = 0.0002). TLR4 expression on intermediate monocytes correlated with vasoactive-inotropic score (rs = 0.642, p = 0.0017), duration of ventilation (rs = 0.485, p = 0.0259), highest serum creatinine (rs = 0.547, p = 0.0102), postsurgical transfusion (total volume per kg bodyweight) (rs = 0.469, p = 0.0321) and lowest mean arterial pressure (rs = -0.530, p = 0.0135). Concentrations of IL-10, MIP-1$\beta$, IL-8, G–CSF and IL-6 increased one hour post CPB. Methylprednisolone administration in six patients had no significant influence on the studied surface receptors but led to lower IL-8 and higher IL-10 plasma concentrations. Conclusions: Congenital heart surgery with CPB induces a systemic inflammatory process including cytokine response and changes in PRR expression. Intermediate monocytes feature specific inflammatory characteristics in the 48 h after pediatric CPB and TLR4 correlates with poorer clinical course, which might provide a potential diagnostic or even therapeutic target.},

abstract = {Iron is necessary for both mammalian cells and microorganisms, which fiercely compete for this essential nutrient. Accordingly, macrophages exploit the denial of iron from microbial pathogens as an important strategy to accomplish their key role in innate immunity and host defense. Macrophages employ multiple mechanisms to accumulate iron and thus contain microbial infections, but this may come at a price. In particular, at the systemic level iron sequestration in the reticuloendothelial cells can lead to the development of anemia of chronic disease. At the local level, iron sequestration in macrophages, which is targeted to extracellular invaders, can in turn favor intracellular pathogens. Moreover, iron accumulation can per se promote pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and consequently contribute to maintain the process of inflammation, without resolution. Finally, the peculiar iron trafficking that characterizes alternatively polarized macrophages can influence neighboring cells in the microenvironment and impact on the resolution phase of inflammation. In this review, we describe the role of macrophages in iron metabolism in the context of host defense and iron balance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},

abstract = {New official nomenclature subdivides human monocytes into 3 subsets: the classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)), intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)), and nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) monocytes. This introduces new challenges, as monocyte heterogeneity is mostly understood based on 2 subsets, the CD16(-) and CD16(+) monocytes. Here, we comprehensively defined the 3 circulating human monocyte subsets using microarray, flow cytometry, and cytokine production analysis. We find that intermediate monocytes expressed a large majority (87%) of genes and surface proteins at levels between classical and nonclassical monocytes. This establishes their intermediary nature at the molecular level. We unveil the close relationship between the intermediate and nonclassic monocytes, along with features that separate them. Intermediate monocytes expressed highest levels of major histocompatibility complex class II, GFR$\alpha$2 and CLEC10A, whereas nonclassic monocytes were distinguished by cytoskeleton rearrangement genes, inflammatory cytokine production, and CD294 and Siglec10 surface expression. In addition, we identify new features for classic monocytes, including AP-1 transcription factor genes, CLEC4D and IL-13R$\alpha$1 surface expression. We also find circumstantial evidence supporting the developmental relationship between the 3 subsets, including gradual changes in maturation genes and surface markers. By comprehensively defining the 3 monocyte subsets during healthy conditions, we facilitate target identification and detailed analyses of aberrations that may occur to monocyte subsets during diseases.},

@article{Ponka1999,
abstract = {The transferrin receptor is a membrane glycoprotein whose only clearly defined function is to mediate cellular uptake of iron from a plasma glycoprotein, transferrin. Iron uptake from transferrin involves the binding of transferrin to the transferrin receptor, internalization of transferrin within an endocytic vesicle by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the release of iron from the protein by a decrease in endosomal pH. With the exception of highly differentiated cells, transferrin receptors are probably expressed on all cells but their levels vary greatly. Transferrin receptors are highly expressed on immature erythroid cells, placental tissue, and rapidly dividing cells, both normal and malignant. In proliferating nonerythroid cells the expression of transferrin receptors is negatively regulated post-transcriptionally by intracellular iron through iron responsive elements (IREs) in the 3' untranslated region of transferrin receptor mRNA. IREs are recognized by specific cytoplasmic proteins (IRPs; iron regulatory proteins) that, in the absence of iron in the labile pool, bind to the IREs of transferrin receptor mRNA, preventing its degradation. On the other hand, the expansion of the labile iron pool leads to a rapid degradation of transferrin receptor mRNA that is not protected since IRPs are not bound to it. However, some cells and tissues with specific requirements for iron probably evolved mechanisms that can override the IRE/IRP-dependent control of transferrin receptor expression. Erythroid cells, which are the most avid consumers of iron in the organism, use a transcriptional mechanism to maintain very high transferrin receptor levels. Transcriptional regulation is also involved in the receptor expression during T and B lymphocyte activation. Macrophages are another example of a cell type that shows 'unorthodox' responses in terms of IRE/IRP paradigm since in these cells elevated iron levels increase (rather than decrease) transferrin receptor mRNA and protein levels. Erythroid cells contain the highest mass of the total organismal transferrin receptors which are released from reticulocytes during their maturation to erythrocytes. Hence, plasma contains small amounts of transferrin receptors which represent a soluble fragment of the extracellular receptor domain. Measurements of serum transferrin receptor concentrations are clinically useful since their levels correlate with the total mass of immature erythroid cells.},

abstract = {The identification of a bacterial, viral, or even noninfectious cause is essential in the management of febrile syndrome in the emergency department (ED), especially in epidemic contexts such as flu or CoVID-19. The aim was to assess discriminative performances of two biomarkers, CD64 on neutrophils (nCD64) and CD169 on monocytes (mCD169), using a new flow cytometry procedure, in patients presenting with fever to the ED during epidemics. Eighty five adult patients presenting with potential infection were included during the 2019 flu season in the ED of La Timone Hospital. They were divided into four diagnostic outcomes according to their clinical records: no-infection, bacterial infection, viral infection and co-infection. Seventy six patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were also compared to 48 healthy volunteers. For the first cohort, 38 (45%) patients were diagnosed with bacterial infections, 11 (13%) with viral infections and 29 (34%) with co-infections. mCD169 was elevated in patients with viral infections, with a majority of Flu A virus or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, while nCD64 was elevated in subjects with bacterial infections, with a majority of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. nCD64 and mCD169 showed 90% and 80% sensitivity, and 78% and 91% specificity, respectively, for identifying patients with bacterial or viral infections. When studied in a second cohort, mCD169 was elevated in 95% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and remained at normal level in 100% of healthy volunteers. nCD64 and mCD169 have potential for accurately distinguishing bacterial and acute viral infections. Combined in an easy and rapid flow cytometry procedure, they constitute a potential improvement for infection management in the ED, and could even help for triage of patients during emerging epidemics.},

Several studies have now established that the hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. Macrophages are a population of innate immune cells that sense and respond to microbial threats by producing inflammatory molecules that eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair. However, a dysregulated macrophage response can be damaging to the host, as is seen in the macrophage activation syndrome induced by severe infections, including in infections with the related virus SARS-CoV. Here we describe the potentially pathological roles of macrophages during SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss ongoing and prospective therapeutic strategies to modulate macrophage activation in patients with COVID-19.},

abstract = {Rationale: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop hyperhomocysteinemia and have a higher cardiovascular mortality than those without hyperhomocysteinemia by 10-fold. Objective: We investigated monocyte differentiation in human CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods and Results: We identified CD40 as a CKD-related monocyte activation gene using CKD-monocyte -mRNA array analysis and classified CD40 monocyte (CD40+CD14+) as a stronger inflammatory subset than the intermediate monocyte (CD14++CD16+) subset. We recruited 27 patients with CVD/CKD and 14 healthy subjects and found that CD40/CD40 classical/CD40 intermediate monocyte (CD40+CD14+/CD40+CD14++CD16-/CD40+CD14++CD16+), plasma homocysteine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and S-adenosylmethionine levels were higher in CVD and further elevated in CVD+CKD. CD40 and CD40 intermediate subsets were positively correlated with plasma/cellular homocysteine levels, S-adenosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine but negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate. Hyperhomocysteinemia was established as a likely mediator for CKD-induced CD40 intermediate monocyte, and reduced S-adenosylhomocysteine/S-adenosylmethionine was established for CKD-induced CD40/CD40 intermediate monocyte. Soluble CD40 ligand, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$/interleukin (IL)-6/interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ levels were elevated in CVD/CKD. CKD serum/homocysteine/CD40L/increased TNF-$\alpha$/IL-6/IFN-$\gamma$-induced CD40/CD40 intermediate monocyte in peripheral blood monocyte. Homocysteine and CKD serum-induced CD40 monocyte were prevented by neutralizing antibodies against CD40L/TNF-$\alpha$/IL-6. DNA hypomethylation was found on nuclear factor-$\kappa$B consensus element in CD40 promoter in white blood cells from patients with CKD with lower S-adenosylmethionine / S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios. Finally, homocysteine inhibited DNA methyltransferase-1 activity and promoted CD40 intermediate monocyte differentiation, which was reversed by folic acid in peripheral blood monocyte. Conclusions: CD40 monocyte is a novel inflammatory monocyte subset that appears to be a biomarker for CKD severity. Hyperhomocysteinemia mediates CD40 monocyte differentiation via soluble CD40 ligand induction and CD40 DNA hypomethylation in CKD.},

We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection.},

abstract = {A benchmarking analysis on single-cell RNA-seq and mass cytometry data reveals the best-performing technique for dimensionality reduction. Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.},

abstract = {Macrophages reside in virtually every organ. First arising during embryogenesis, macrophages replenish themselves in the adult through a combination of self-renewal and influx of bone marrow-derived monocytes. As large phagocytic cells, macrophages participate in innate immunity while contributing to tissue-specific homeostatic functions. Among the key metabolic tasks are senescent red blood cell recycling, free heme detoxification, and provision of iron for de novo hemoglobin synthesis. While this systemic mechanism involves the shuttling of iron between spleen, liver, and bone marrow through the concerted function of defined macrophage populations, similar circuits appear to exist within the microenvironment of other organs. The high turnover of iron is the prerequisite for continuous erythropoiesis and tissue integrity but challenges macrophages' ability to maintain cellular iron homeostasis and immune function. This review provides a brief overview of systemic, microenvironmental, and cellular aspects of macrophage iron handling with a focus on exciting and unresolved questions in the field.},

abstract = {It is well‑known that monocytes are a heterogeneous cell population and different monocyte subsets play important roles in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Cluster of differentiation (CD)64 is one of Fc receptor, which initiates immunological and inflammatory reactions. However, the roles in RA remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the expression of CD64, CD40, CD163, CD206, HLA‑DR, CD80 and CD86 on monocytes and the expression of CD64 on monocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry. The expression of CD64 on monocyte subsets in patients with RA was further analyzed for their correlation with markers of autoimmune response, inflammation, disease activity of RA and serum cytokines. Compared to the health volunteers, the expression of CD64 on monocytes and each monocyte subset were significantly elevated in RA patients. The expression of CD64 on CD14++CD16‑ and CD14++CD16+ monocytes were positively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C‑reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti‑citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and disease activity score 28 (DAS28). Furthermore, the expression of CD64 on CD14++CD16+ monocytes was found to be associated with the serum level of IL‑6. In conclusions, these data demonstrated the expression of CD64 on CD14++CD16‑ and CD14++CD16+ monocytes are elevated and associated with the disease activity in RA.},

abstract = {Human primary monocytes are heterogeneous in terms of phenotype and function, but are sub-divided only based on CD16 and CD14 expression. CD16 expression distinguishes a subset of monocytes with highly pro-inflammatory properties from non-CD16 expressing "classical" monocytes. CD14 expression further subdivides the CD16+ monocytes into non-classical CD14low and intermediate CD14high subsets. This long-standing CD16-CD14 classification system, however, has limitations as CD14 is expressed in a continuum, leading to subjectivity in delineating the non-classical and intermediate subsets; in addition, CD16 expression is unstable, making identification of the subsets impossible after in vitro culture or during inflammatory conditions in vivo. Hence, we aimed to identify the three monocyte subsets using an alternative combination of markers. Additionally, we wanted to address whether the monocyte subset perturbations observed during infection is real or an artifact of differential CD16 and/or CD14 regulation. Using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), we studied the simultaneous expression of 34 monocyte markers on total monocytes, and derived a combination of five markers (CD33, CD86, CD64, HLA-DR, and CCR2), that could objectively delineate the three subsets. Using these markers, we could also distinguish CD16+ monocytes from CD16- monocytes after in vitro stimulation. Finally, we found that the observed expansion of intermediate (CD14high) monocytes in dengue virus-infected patients was due to up-regulated CD16 expression on classical monocytes. With our new combination of markers, we can now identify monocyte subsets without CD16 and CD14, and accurately re-examine monocyte subset perturbations in diseases.},

Here we show a COVID-19 immune signature associated with severity by integrating single-cell RNA-seq analysis from blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. This signature is characterized by lung accumulation of na{\"{i}}ve lymphoid cells associated with a systemic expansion and activation of myeloid cells. Myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution, highlighting arginase-1 expression with immune regulatory features of monocytes. Monocyte-dependent and neutrophil-dependent immune suppression loss is associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe patients. Additionally, our analysis shows a lung CXCR6+ effector memory T cell subset is associated with better prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19-induced myeloid dysregulation and lymphoid impairment establish a condition of ‘immune silence' in patients with critical COVID-19.},

Even though a majority of the population develops only minor symptoms upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, a significant number are hospitalized at intensive care units (ICU) requiring critical care. While insights into the early stages of the disease are rapidly expanding, the dynamic immunological processes occurring in critically ill patients throughout their recovery at ICU are far less understood. Here, we have analysed whole blood samples serially collected from 40 surviving COVID-19 patients throughout their recovery in ICU using high-dimensional cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and cytokine multiplexing. Based on the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), we defined four sequential immunotypes during recovery that correlated to various clinical parameters, including the level of respiratory support at concomitant sampling times. We identified classical monocytes as the first immune cell type to recover by restoration of HLA-DR-positivity and the reduction of immunosuppressive CD163 + monocytes, followed by the recovery of CD8 + and CD4 + T cell and non-classical monocyte populations. The identified immunotypes also correlated to aberrant cytokine and acute-phase reactant levels. Finally, integrative analysis of cytokines and immune cell profiles showed a shift from an initially dysregulated immune response to a more coordinated immunogenic interplay, highlighting the importance of longitudinal sampling to understand the pathophysiology underlying recovery from severe COVID-19.},

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes are crucial mediators of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection, but misdirected responses by these cells may contribute to immunopathology. Here, we performed high-dimensional flow cytometry-analysis focusing on mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) lineages in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. We provide a deep and comprehensive map of the MNP landscape in COVID-19. A redistribution of monocyte subsets toward intermediate monocytes and a general decrease in circulating DCs was observed in response to infection. Severe disease coincided with the appearance of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2. Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineage-specific and associated either with the general response against SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 severity. This included an interferon-imprint in DC1s observed in all patients and a decreased expression of the coinhibitory molecule CD200R in pre-DCs, DC2s, and DC3 subsets of severely sick patients. Finally, unsupervised analysis revealed that the MNP profile, alone, pointed to a cluster of COVID-19 nonsurvivors. This study provides a reference for the MNP response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and unravels mononuclear phagocyte dysregulations associated with severe COVID-19.},

abstract = {Infections with SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe clinical manifestations. As such patients present with systemic inflammation, we studied the prevalence and predictive value of anemia of inflammation (AI) or functional iron deficiency (FID), originating from immune-mediated alterations of iron homeostasis. Within this retrospective analysis of 259 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we found that, upon admission, 24.7% were anemic, with the majority suffering from AI (68.8%). Anemia was associated with a significantly higher in-hospital mortality (OR 3.729 (95%CI 1.739–7.995), p = 0.001) but not an increased frequency of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or need for mechanical ventilation. FID was present in 80.0% of patients upon admission, linked to more advanced inflammation and associated with significantly longer hospital stay. Notably, a ferritin/transferrin ratio > 10 predicted a five-fold higher risk of ICU admission and an eight-fold higher risk of the need for mechanical ventilation. Anemia and alterations of iron homeostasis are highly prevalent in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Iron metabolism biomarkers and hemoglobin can contribute to risk stratification of patients, as initial anemia is associated with increased mortality, whereas alterations of iron homeostasis with a higher ferritin/transferrin ratio reflect more advanced inflammation and predicts subsequent insufficient pulmonary oxygenation with the need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {Neutrophils and monocytes encompassing the classical, intermediate, and nonclassical population constitute the majority of circulating myeloid cells in humans and represent the first line of innate immune defense. As such, changes in their relative and absolute amounts serve as sensitive markers of diverse inflammatory conditions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, causing demyelination and axonal loss, affecting various neuron functions and often causing irreversible neurological disability. MS disease course is individually highly heterogeneous but can be classified as progressive (PMS) or relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Each MS course type may be further characterized as active or inactive, depending on the recent disability progression and/or current relapses. Data on specific alterations of the myeloid compartment in association with MS disease course are scarce and conflicting. In the current study, we systematically immunophenotyped blood myeloid leukocytes by flow cytometry in 15 healthy and 65 MS subjects. We found a highly significant expansion of granulocytes, CD15+ neutrophils, and classical and nonclassical monocytes in inactive RRMS (RRMSi) with concomitant shrinkage of the lymphocyte compartment, which did not correlate with biochemical readouts of systemic inflammation. Each of these leukocyte populations and the combined myeloid signature accurately differentiated RRMSi from other MS forms. Additionally, nonclassical monocyte proportions were particularly elevated in RRMSi individuals receiving disease-modifying therapy (DMT), such as natalizumab. Our results suggest that flow cytometry-based myeloid cell immunophenotyping in MS may help to identify RRMSi earlier and facilitate monitoring of DMT response.},

abstract = {Improved understanding and management of COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease, could greatly reduce the threat posed by its etiologic agent, SARS-CoV-2. Toward this end, we have identified a core peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated patients with COVID-19 who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The signature includes discrete changes in B and myelomonocytic cell composition, profoundly altered T cell phenotypes, selective cytokine/chemokine upregulation and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Some signature traits identify links with other settings of immunoprotection and immunopathology; others, including basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion, correlate strongly with disease severity; while a third set of traits, including a triad of IP-10, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6, anticipate subsequent clinical progression. Hence, contingent upon independent validation in other COVID-19 cohorts, individual traits within this signature may collectively and individually guide treatment options; offer insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis; and aid early, risk-based patient stratification that is particularly beneficial in phasic diseases such as COVID-19.},

abstract = {Background: An unbiased approach to SARS-CoV-2-induced immune dysregulation has not been undertaken so far. We aimed to identify previously unreported immune markers able to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls and to predict mild and severe disease. Methods: An observational, prospective, multicentric study was conducted in patients with confirmed mild/moderate (n = 7) and severe (n = 19) COVID-19. Immunophenotyping of whole-blood leukocytes was performed in patients upon hospital ward or intensive care unit admission and in healthy controls (n = 25). Clinically relevant associations were identified through unsupervised analysis. Results: Granulocytic (neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil) markers were enriched during COVID-19 and discriminated between patients with mild and severe disease. Increased counts of CD15+CD16+ neutrophils, decreased granulocytic expression of integrin CD11b, and Th2-related CRTH2 downregulation in eosinophils and basophils established a COVID-19 signature. Severity was associated with emergence of PD-L1 checkpoint expression in basophils and eosinophils. This granulocytic signature was accompanied by monocyte and lymphocyte immunoparalysis. Correlation with validated clinical scores supported pathophysiological relevance. Conclusions: Phenotypic markers of circulating granulocytes are strong discriminators between infected and uninfected individuals as well as between severity stages. COVID-19 alters the frequency and functional phenotypes of granulocyte subsets with emergence of CRTH2 as a disease biomarker.},

abstract = {Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–4. However, the longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here we serially analysed immune responses in 113 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages, with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. An early elevation in cytokine levels was associated with worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, patients with moderate COVID-19 displayed a progressive reduction in type 1 (antiviral) and type 3 (antifungal) responses. By contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of the disease. Moreover, severe COVID-19 was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors, including interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-13, immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four immune signatures, representing growth factors (A), type-2/3 cytokines (B), mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines (C), and chemokines (D) that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories. The immune profiles of patients who recovered from moderate COVID-19 were enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature A, whereas the profiles of those with who developed severe disease had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we have identified a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcome, as well as early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.},

abstract = {<p>Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection range from mild to critically severe. The aim of the study was to highlight the immunological events associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an emphasis on cells of innate immunity. Thirty COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate symptoms and 27 patients with severe/critically severe symptoms were recruited from the Clinical Center of Kragujevac during April 2020. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to reveal phenotypic and functional alterations of peripheral blood cells and to correlate them with the severity of the disease. In severe cases, the number of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and HLA-DR-expressing cells was drastically decreased. In the monocyte population proportion between certain subsets was disturbed and cells coexpressing markers of M1 and M2 monocytes were found in intermediate and non-classical subsets. In mild cases decline in lymphocyte number was less pronounced and innate immunity was preserved as indicated by an increased number of myeloid and activated dendritic cells, NK cells that expressed activation marker at the same level as in control and by low expression of M2 marker in monocyte population. In patients with severe disease, both innate and adoptive immunity are devastated, while in patients with mild symptoms decline in lymphocyte number is lesser, and the innate immunity is preserved.</p>},
