Immunophenotyping of blood myeloid leukocytes from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients

This is an analysis pipeline accompanying a manuscript by David Haschka et al, currently under review. Source 'exec_all.R' to run the entire pipeline. The in-house developed packages used in the analysis: figur (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/figur), ExDA (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/ExDA) and soucer (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/soucer) are available from my GitHub.
