This is an analysis pipeline accompanying a manuscript by David Haschka et al, currently under review. Source 'exec_all.R' to run the entire pipeline. The in-house developed packages used in the analysis: _figur_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/figur), _ExDA_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/ExDA) and _soucer_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/soucer), _clustTools_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/clustTools) and _somKernels_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/somKernels) are available from my GitHub.
